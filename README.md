# Takeout Application

## Purpose
Ultimately, the purpose of this repository is learning.  I have extensive experience in the restaurant industry, so I feel this is a good starting project with potential real world applications.

## Planned Progress

Several phases are likely to occur prior to a web application:

1. Pure C++
    * Essentially a closed one computer application mock up of logic
2. Pure Java
    * for similar reasons as C++, idea is to understand new problems that could come up when translating code to a new language
3. Java backend with Javascript frontend
    * Also potentially exploring React.js library
